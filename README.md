Perfection is overrated. Consistency is more important (going after perfection means that you are insecure. You do not want anyone to say negative things about you.  Make yourself proud) 

Why is more important than What.

Nature is the greatest Wonder 

Consistency Beats Persistence. 

Solve Bigger Problems 

Listen Good Things 
   Basically when people talk we hear negative things first . This happens more for people who have a troubled past. Our ears Make a heart when they are joined together.. may be its an indication of listening to good things. This is an idea that needs to be made in a graphic poster. I have attached a sample image for idea. Also work on words to make them better

Show dont tell , tech do not demand. 

Copywrite put right people in right job. Do not put sqare pegs n round holes. 

What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you. " german quote"

Truth Bombs : 1 People do not quit jobs they quit situations
2 your past salary has no relationship to your future salary. ( YOu do not pursue success its an outcome of what you perform )

3 Can you do the job > DO you want to do the job ( which company wants to get done)

Suspects prospects Targets ( your steaks and their means )  
                               hard data and soft data research WANTS 
                               
Finitiative is more important than initiative. ( Finishing your initiatitves )
I believe in quitting ( before its too late )

There is too much power in the hands of the HR you need to extract that power back to employee.

Tomorrow will be harder

The things you don’t do drain a lot more of your energy than the things you do.
